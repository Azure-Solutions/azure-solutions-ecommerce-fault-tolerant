# Solution Architecture: Simple Digital Marketing Website

Your simple digital marketing website will be built from multiple Azure services, and you have some technology decisions to make and some considerations to be aware of.

First, you will have to decide how you will manage your website's application lifecycle.
Regardless of the web framework you choose, you have to decide how you're going to host it: either using Paas (platform-as-a-service) or IaaS (infrastructure-as-a-service.)
